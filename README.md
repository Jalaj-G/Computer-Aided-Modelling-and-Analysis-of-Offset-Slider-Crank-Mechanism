# Computer-Aided-Modelling-and-Analysis-of-Offset-Slider-Crank-Mechanism
Modelled the offset-slider crank mechanism and performed Kinematic &amp; Dynamic analysis along with joint clearance analysis in Adams software and validated with theoretical results
Results & Discussion:The torque required to maintain the mechanism in equilibrium in the first position, analytically obtained is 70.70 N mm, which is similar to torque of 70.5 N
mm estimated through simulation 
Refer Term Project 2 for above values considered for calculating percentage accuracy.
It can be calculated as: (70.5/70.7)*100 = 99.7171 or 99.91
